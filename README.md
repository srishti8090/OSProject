Memory management
In a multiprogramming computer, the operating system resides in a part of memory and the rest is used by
multiple processes. The task of subdividing the memory among different processes is called memory
management. Memory management is a method in the operating system to manage operations between
main memory and disk during process execution. The main aim of memory management is to achieve
efficient utilization of memory.
Our project  is a memory manager simulation that allocates and deallocates memory in response 
to process requests with two algorithms Best-Fit and Buddy. 
In the case of the best fit memory allocation scheme, the operating system searches for the empty memory block.
When the operating system finds the memory block with minimum wastage of memory, it is allocated to the process this
is known as Best Fit Algorithm in Operating System.
The Buddy System is a memory allocation technique used in computer operating systems to efficiently allocate and manage memory.
The technique is based on dividing the memory into fixed-size blocks, and whenever a process requests memory,
the system finds the smallest available block that can accommodate the requested memory size.
